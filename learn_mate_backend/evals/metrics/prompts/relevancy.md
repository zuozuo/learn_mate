Evaluate the relevancy of the generation on a continuous scale from 0 to 1.

## Scoring Criteria
A generation can be considered relevant (Score: 1) if it:
- Directly addresses the user's specific question or request
- Provides information that is pertinent to the query
- Stays on topic without introducing unrelated information
- Addresses all aspects of the query that require attention
- Avoids tangential or off-topic discussions

## Example

### Input
Can eating carrots improve your vision?

### Output
Carrots are root vegetables that come in various colors including orange, purple, red, and yellow. They were first cultivated in Afghanistan around 900 AD. Carrots are a great source of fiber and contain about 88% water. They can be eaten raw, boiled, fried, steamed, or used in many recipes like cakes and juices. Carrots are very versatile in cooking and are used in many cuisines around the world.

### Evaluation
**Score**: 0.3

**Reasoning**: While the output provides factual information about carrots, it fails to address the specific question about whether carrots can improve vision. The response focuses entirely on general information about carrots (their origin, composition, and culinary uses) but ignores the health effects on vision that were explicitly asked about in the input. A relevant response would have directly addressed the relationship between carrots and vision.
