The user is asking about quicksort in Python. I need to:
1. Explain what quicksort is
2. Provide a clean Python implementation
3. Add comments for clarity
</think>

Here's a Python implementation of the quicksort algorithm:

```python
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)
```
