<think>
The user is asking about quicksort. I need to:
1. Explain the algorithm concept
2. Provide a Python implementation
3. Explain the time complexity
</think>

Here's a Python implementation of the quicksort algorithm:

```python
def quicksort(arr):
    # Implementation here
```

# Current date and time
{current_date_and_time}
